## Overview
This repository provides a complete Continuous Deployment (CD) starter kit for SLIM projects, enabling automated, efficient, and secure deployments. It follows best practices for CI/CD workflows, environment management, security, and rollback strategies.

## Features
- Automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Secure environment variable management.
- Zero-downtime deployment with blue/green and canary strategies.
- Multi-environment support for testing and validation.
- Integrated security scanning and compliance checks.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and Kubernetes.

## Quick Start
This guide provides a quick way to get started with our project. Please see our [docs](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/slim/) for a more comprehensive overview.

### Requirements
* Terraform
* AWS CLI / Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
* GitHub Actions enabled
* Docker for containerized deployments

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim-cd-starterkit.git
cd slim-cd-starterkit
```
2. Set Up Environment Variables
Use AWS Systems Manager (SSM), HashiCorp Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets for managing secrets securely.
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
```
3. Deploy Infrastructure
Use Terraform for managing cloud resources:
```bash
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
4. Run CI/CD Pipeline
Ensure your code passes tests before deployment.
```bash
git push origin main
```
GitHub Actions will automatically:
- Run tests (unit, integration, security checks).
- Build and package the application.
- Deploy to the staging environment.

5. Promote to Production
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
name: Deploy to Staging
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        run: ./deploy.sh staging
```

## Security & Compliance
- Use [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/) for security scanning.
- Enforce RBAC for cloud resources.
- Regularly audit deployment logs.
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.

## Rollback Strategy
- Maintain versioned deployment artifacts.
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts.
- Implement automated rollback mechanisms using deployment history.

## Monitoring & Logging
- Integrate Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack for observability.
- Set up alerts for deployment failures.
- Use centralized logging for debugging and analysis.
